# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

  title: "First Post"
  body: "This is my body"
# column: value
#
two:
  title: "Second Post"
  body: "This is another body"
# column: value
